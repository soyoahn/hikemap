# üçé What's this? 
The purpose of this githup repo is to provide a simple way to exercise writing REST API documentation in a public repo. 

After this, the plan is to have gained enough confidence to contribute to some actual open source documentation! 

# This is not "actual" documentation? 
No, Hikemap is a fictitious service that uses a simple json db and json-server to read, add, and update hiking trails, users, and trail reviews added by those users. 

Track favorite hikes and discover new trails based on location and difficulty
