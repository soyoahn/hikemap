# ü§î What's this repo? 
[About Hikemap](ahttps://soyoahn.github.io/hikemap/about.html) | The purpose of this repo is to provide a simple way to practice writing REST API documentation in a public repo. After this, I'll have gained the confidence to contribute to actual open source documentation! 

# This is not "actual" documentation? 
No. Hikemap is a fictitious service that uses a simple json db and json-server to read, add, and update hiking trails, users, and trail reviews.
