# Hikemap Web API Overview
 Hikemap resources include trails, reviews, and users.
 
 For details about hikemap's features, see [About Hikemap](about.html).

# Getting Started
To run a few basic CRUD functions on the Hikemap API, all you need is a Github account and the following programs installed:
* Github Desktop
* PowerShell
* json-server and cURL

**Try it out!** Follow this tutorial to make your first Hikemap API call to our sample database:
* [Set up your development environment](tutorial-getting-started.html)

Then, use these further tutorials to understand how to do POST and PUT methods on these resources:
* Hikes
    * [Add a new trail](tutorial-create-task.md/) `POST`
    * [Update attributes on an existing hike](update-task-with-patch.md) `PUT`
* Users

    * Remove a user
* Reviews
    * [Add a review](tutorial-create-task.md/) `POST`
